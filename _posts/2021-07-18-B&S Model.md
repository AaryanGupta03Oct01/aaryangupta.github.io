The Black & Scholes Model is considered one of the best models to fairly estimate the option premiums. It requires 5 input variables: The Strike price of the option, the current price of the stock, risk-free rate, time to expiration & `Volatility`  . Note that we are assuming no dividends are to be paid out during the options life.

**C** = call option price<br>**N** = CDF of the normal distribution<br>**S** = spot price of an asset <br>**K** = strike price <br>**r ** = risk-free interest rate <br>**t ** = time to maturity (in yrs.) <br>**Ïƒ** = volatility of the asset <br>

The basic principle of an option pricing model is to calculate the theoretical worth of an option contract at the time of expiration.

This model assumes that returns on the stock are normally distributed, i.e., probabilities of all possible stock prices at the time of expiration assume a normal distribution. Note that as far as this model is concerned, we only care about European options (i.e., they can only be exercised at expiration). Also, transaction costs are ignored.

## Using python to implement a premium calculator based on B&S Model

For the Black Scholes formula, we need to calculate the probability of receiving the stock at the expiration of the option as well a the risk-adjusted probability that the option will be exercised. So first we calculate d1 & d2, and then input them into a normal distribution function to obtain the probabilities `N(d1)` & `N(d2)`. 

```python
from math import log, sqrt, pi, exp
from scipy.stats import norm
from datetime import datetime, date
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas import DataFrame

def d1(S,K,T,r,sigma):
    return(log(S/K)+(r+sigma**2/2.)*T)/sigma*sqrt(T)
def d2(S,K,T,r,sigma):
    return d1(S,K,T,r,sigma)-sigma*sqrt(T)
```

Now, the above mentioned formula can be implemented by using the values calculated in the above functions. Note that the formula for the put option can be obtained by modifying the call option formula. The additive & subtractive terms get replaced (because we profit from the prices going down), and the risk -adjusted probabilities, `N(d1)` &`N(d2)` change to `1-N(d1)` and `1-N(d2)`.

```python
def ce_bs(S,K,T,r,sigma):
    return S*norm.cdf(d1(S,K,T,r,sigma))-K*exp(-r*T)*norm.cdf(d2(S,K,T,r,sigma))

def pe_bs(S,K,T,r,sigma):
    return K*exp(-r*T)-S+ce_bs(S,K,T,r,sigma)
```

## Working with Data

Python Pandas library can be used to import historical data for the stock from Yahoo Finance website.

All the inputs can be easily obtained by just looking at the available market data, except the Volatility (sigma). This is essentially because there is no way to accurately determine the volatility of the stock during the option's life. Here, the volatility is assumed the same as it was during the past year, and can be calculated by finding the standard deviation of the stock prices during the past year.

As far as the risk free rate is concerned, we have used the 10-year U.S. Treasury Yield which can be obtained by ^TNX. 

The closing price of the stock is used for the current price input.

```python
from datetime import datetime, date
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader.data as web

stock = 'GOOG'
expiry = '07-23-2021'    #correct date needs to be given
strike_price = 2520     #relevant price needs to be mentioned

today = datetime.now()
one_year_ago = today.replace(year=today.year-1)

df = web.DataReader(stock, 'yahoo', one_year_ago, today)    #importing data from Yahoo Finance

df = df.sort_values(by="Date")
df = df.dropna()
df = df.assign(close_day_before=df.Close.shift(1))
df['returns'] = ((df.Close - df.close_day_before)/df.close_day_before)

sigma = np.sqrt(252) * df['returns'].std()
uty = web.DataReader("^TNX", 'yahoo', today.replace(day=today.day-1), today)['Close'].iloc[-1]
lcp = df['Close'].iloc[-1]
t = ( datetime.strptime(expiry, "%m-%d-%Y") - datetime.utcnow()).days / 365
print('The Option Price is: ', ce_bs(lcp, strike_price, t, uty, sigma))
```

Similar code can be implemented for put option premiums too by giving relevant strike prices & expiration dates as input.
